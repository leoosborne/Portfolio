Project Brief: Since I have been working in a startup for the last four years, I need a to refresh my Portfolio. This simple and elegantly designed website will highlight my front-end dev and UX design skills while meeting the highest standards for semantic HTML and Accessibility. The site will allow users to...

1) Quickly see a few examples of my UX design and front-end dev projects.
2) Obtain a high-level view of my startup management experience, and
3) Easily take the next steps to get in touch with me.
