**Project Brief:** I need to refresh my portfolio. This simple portfolio website will highlight my front-end dev, UX design skills and experience.

**Project Goals:** The site will allow users to...
1) Quickly see a few examples of my projects.
2) Obtain a high-level view of my lean startup and project management experience.
3) Easily take the next steps to get in touch with me.

**Special Instructions**
* Github Pages site: https://leoosborne.github.io/Portfolio/

* The Javascript Hamburger Menu uses an @media screen (max-width: 490px), which is too small to see by resizing the screen on a desktop view. Take a look in the dev tools to see the menu functionality. 

* You can also load the Github Pages URL on your phone, but the menu doesn't work as the main.js doesn't load (static files only).
