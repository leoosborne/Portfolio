**Project Brief** 
I need to refresh my portfolio. This simple portfolio website will highlight my front-end dev, UX design skills and experience while meeting the standards for semantic HTML and WCAG Level AA accessibility. Mobile first layout will be styled with flexbox and use media queries for the following viewport sizes: 
* Mobile: 320 - 480px
* Tablet: 481 - 768px
* Small laptop: 769 - 1024px
* Large laptop and beyond: 1025px +

**Project Goal**
The site will allow users to...
1) Quickly see a few examples of my projects.
2) Obtain a high-level view of my lean startup and project management experience.
3) Easily take the next steps to get in touch with me.

**Features** 
[ the four required features project will use ]
1) Create fully accessible responsive menu with CSS and HTML.
2) Obtain PageSpeed Insights with a score of 80 or better.
3) Run an accessibility check, fix any issues and document process in the final README.md.
4) Animate all buttons and the mobile menu.
