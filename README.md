# Portfolio
Portfolio Website for Q1 '23:

Portfolio projects will likely include: 

* StructuRight Portal MVP redesign: Case Study and clickable Prototype (desktop only)
* StructuRight iOS app design: Case Study, and clickable Prototype
* Custom Design System for StructuRight
* Juniata.edu case study: Case Study, clickable Prototype and link to site


Project Brief: Since I have been working inside [StructuRight](https://www.structuright.com/) for the last four years, I need to refresh my portfolio. This simple and elegantly designed website will highlight my front-end dev and UX design skills while meeting the highest standards for semantic HTML and Accessibility. The site will allow users to...

1) Quickly see a few examples of my UX design and front-end dev projects.
2) Obtain a high-level view of my lean startup and project management experience.
3) Easily take the next steps to get in touch with me.
